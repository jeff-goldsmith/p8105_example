```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The purpose of this file is to examine a few data types (or data classes) in R.

First we create a dataframe containing variables of four different types.

```{r}
example_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = 5:8,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Jeff"),
  vec_logical = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))
)
```

The variable `vec_numeric` has class `r class(example_df$vec_numeric)`, and the variable `vec_factor` has class `r class(example_df$vec_factor)`.
